// derail.js — say WHAT the guest is executing when it is no longer executing code.
//
// Four separate investigations in one day started from a message that named an opcode and nothing
// else, and in all four the opcode was innocent — the guest had left its own code and we were
// decoding whatever it landed in:
//
//   Turbo Pascal   jumped to fffe:0002, ran off the 1 MB wrap into the interrupt vector table, and
//                  vector 0 (0f53:010c) decoded as "0f 53" — an SSE opcode in a 1989 program.
//   MS-DOS 6.22    same table, where "62 07" decodes as BOUND, so an unhandled #BR looped 3 M times.
//   test386        the IDT, whose gate access bytes 8e/ee read as an instruction.
//   Crystal Dream 2  its own error string: "…ception faul…" executed as code.
//
// Each time the first move was to implement or investigate the opcode, and each time that was wrong.
// So the address gets classified rather than merely printed. This runs only on a diagnostic path —
// a fault that is about to be reported — never on the hot path.

 * nor printable. The detector used to index physical memory with the linear address, so under a
 * DPMI host every block above the host's own mapping looked like "a run of zero bytes": xcom144's
 * "derail" at 00AF:2B915 (linear 13C915h, frame FBF000h) was the real code, read from the wrong place.
