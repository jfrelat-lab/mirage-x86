// cpu-profile.js — which x86 generation MIRAGE claims to be.
//
// Until now it was a hybrid nobody ever shipped: 8088 semantics on some 16-bit corners, 286
// behaviour on others (shift counts masked to 5 bits, PUSH SP pushing the original value), and 386
// decoding for 0x66/0x67/SIB. That seam is not academic: several of these differences are
// exactly how a DOS program DETECTS the CPU, so a program can reach a conclusion about the machine
// that no real machine would support, and then pick a code path on it.
//
// A profile makes the choice explicit and testable. Nearly all of it resolves at TRANSLATION time —
// the recompiler is a code generator, so a profile field becomes a constant in the emitted JS and
// costs nothing on the hot path.
//
// Only fields that are actually consumed live here. The rest of the generation table — `PUSHA`,
// `BOUND`, `ENTER`/`LEAVE` raising #UD below a 186, `0x66`/`0x67`/SIB/`MOVZX`/`SHLD` raising #UD
// below a 386, and the undefined-flag values after MUL/DIV/BCD — is deliberately NOT here yet.
// Declaring fields nothing reads would be fiction. Quantifying the undefined-flag differences needs
// the hardware-generated 286/386 vector suites (SingleStepTests/80286, /80386); those ship in a
// binary MOO container rather than the 8088 set's JSON, so consuming them is its own piece of work.
